# Experiment 1

## Setup
- AMD Ryzen 5 5500U with Radeon Graphics
- minimize the number of running applications 
- power:
    1. plugged
    2. battery
- single benchmark task: `belle2-gen-sim-reco-bmk`

## Measurements
For the different limits of CPU frequency measure
- benchmark score
- execution time
- system power usage (using perf)
- battery discharge (approximate)
