# Experiment 1

## Setup
- Azure VM
- Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8171M CPU @ 2.60GHz
- nothing is running except the experiment environment  
- various workloads:
    1. `belle2-gen-sim-reco-bmk`
    2. `atlas-gen-bmk`
    3. `cms-reco-bmk`

## Measurements
For the different limits of CPU frequency measure
- benchmark score
- execution time
- system power usage (using powertop, may be very approximate)
